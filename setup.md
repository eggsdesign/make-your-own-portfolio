# Setup instructions

## Install Git

What is Git? Git is a tool that helps with code collaboration, and development in code projects. It is kind of like a version history for your code files, but also much more. It is insanely useful, but this will probably not be apparent until you have used it for a while.

2. Type `xcode-select --install` and follow the steps from the installer.
3. When the installer is done, close the Terminal.app
