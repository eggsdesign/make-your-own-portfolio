# Setup instructions

## Install Git

What is Git? Git is a tool that helps with code collaboration, and development in code projects. It is kind of like a version history for your code files, but also much more. It is insanely useful, but this will probably not be apparent until you have used it for a while.

1. Go to the Git website and download the installer.
2. Run the installer and follow the steps.
3. Open your Terminal.app and type in `git --version` and hit Enter. This is to check if git was properly installed. If you get an error message, call out for help.

2. Open VSCode
