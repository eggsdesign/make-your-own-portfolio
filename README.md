# Make your own portfolio

With HTML, CSS and Javascript! In this course we are going to code a portfolio, and host it with (GitHub Pages)[https://pages.github.com/]. This will give you an introduction to web technology and Git, which should be a solid foundation to build your continued code mastery upon.

## Day 1

- Install Git
- Signing up to GitHub
- Creating a repository
- Installing VS Code
- Creating an HTML file
- Adding style with CSS
- Publishing to GitHub Pages

### Install Git

What is Git? Git is a tool that helps with code collaboration, and development in code projects. It is kind of like a version history for your code files, but also much more. It is insanely useful, but this will probably not be apparent until you have used it for a while.

1. On your mac, open the terminal.app
2. Type in `xcode-select --install` and hit Enter. This will install git on your machine.
3. Type in `git --version` and hit Enter. This is to check if git was properly installed. If you get an error message, call out for help.

### Sign up to GitHub

Go to github.com in your web browser and sign up.

### Creating a repository

1. After logging in to GitHub.com, click on the `New` button to create a new repository.
2. Give it a nice name â€“ I called mine `my-portfolio`, and make sure it is set to **public**.
3. Copy the generated repo link (mine looks like this `https://github.com/avanvik/my-portfolio.git`), and open your terminal.app.
4. Navigate to your project folder of choice with `cd <Folder name>` and then type `git clone <repository-url>`. This will copy the project folder from GitHub onto your machine, with a magical link that lets you upload and download your code to GitHub while you are developing.
