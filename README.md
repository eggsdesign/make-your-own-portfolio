# Make your own portfolio

With HTML, CSS and Javascript! In this course we are going to code a portfolio, and host it with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This will give you an introduction to web technology and Git, which should be a solid foundation to build your continued code mastery upon.

## Day 1

- Install Git
- Install VSCode
- Sign up to GitHub
- Create a repository
- Create an HTML file
- Add style with CSS
- Publish to GitHub Pages

### Install Git, VSCode and sign up to GitHub

You can follow [these steps](./setup.md)

### Create a repository on GitHub

To make hosting simpler, follow these steps closely

1. Make sure you are logged in to GitHub. Click the GitHub logo to navigate to the front page.
2. Click on the `New` button to create a new repository.
3. Name it `<username>.github.io`. In my case, the repo is called `avanvik.github.io` This will make hosting with GitHub Pages work almost like magic âœ¨
4. Copy the generated repo link (mine looks like this `https://github.com/avanvik/avanvik.github.io.git`)
5. In VSCode, click `clone directory...` and paste in the GitHub repo url. Pick where you want to put the project. I usually put mine in `Documents/Projects/`.

### Create an HTML file

1. In VSCode, create a new file in your project folder.
2. Name it `index.html` and open the file.
