# Make your own portfolio

With HTML, CSS and Javascript! In this course we are going to code a portfolio, and host it with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This will give you an introduction to web technology and Git, which should be a solid foundation to build your continued code mastery upon.

## Install Git, VSCode and sign up to GitHub
